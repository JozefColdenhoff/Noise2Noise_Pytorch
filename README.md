# Noise2Noise Pytorch

Implementation of the [Noise2Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04189) framework in Pytorch. 
The implementation was created as a project for the Deep Learning course EE-559 at EPFL.

## Setup
In order to use the code, place the [data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1CYsJ5gJkZWZAXJ1oQgUpGX7q5PxYEuNs) in the root folder of the repository.

## Usage

MiniProject_2 contains the `model.py` file. This file contains custom implementations of various PyTorch modules including Conv2d, ConvTranspose2d, Adam, SGD etc. 
These implementations can be used similarly to the original PyTorch implementations, the `Miniproject_2/Report_2.pdf` contains more information on the way the modules were implemented.
